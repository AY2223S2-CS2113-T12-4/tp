### Project: WellNUS++
WellNUS++ is a CLI application with a variety of features. Each feature focuses on a different aspect of wellness. 
WellNUS++ aims to help NUS computing and engineering students improve their overall wellness and obtain better self 
achievements.

**Role and responsibility**<br>
Wenxin played the role of the team lead. She is responsible for the overall project coordination and in charge of defining,
assigning, and tracking project tasks to ensure project deliverables are done on time and in the right format.
She is in charge of the program and testing of TextUi class and Self Reflection section.

**Key contributions to the project:**
- **New Feature 1:** TextUi class to read user input and print output.
  - What it does: Read user inputs from terminal and print output with a user-friendly layout (e.g. line separator,
normal message and error message).
  - Justification: This feature is fundamental as it allows users to input commands and receive outputs from WellNUS++.
This class is used throughout WellNUS++. 
  - Highlights: Exclamation marks are used as separators for error messages to catch users' attention. 
An error note section is designed to complement error messages to guide users on using WellNUS++.
- **New Feature 2:** Get a random set of self reflection questions.
  - What it does: Allows users to get a **random set of 5 reflection questions**, generated from a list of 10 questions
using `get` command.
  - Justification: This is fundamental for Self Reflection section as it gives users an opportunity to think 
and reflect on themselves. The set of questions is designed to be randomised so that users can reflect on different aspects
of lives.
  - Highlights: Multiple data structures are used for the randomised set of questions. An **arrayList** of 10 questions 
will be loaded upon launching the program. A **set** of 5 randomised distinct integers ranging from 0-9 will be generated.
This **set** of integers are the used as the index of questions in the **arrayList** to select the corresponding questions.
- **New Feature 3:** Like self reflection questions.
  - What it does: Allows users to add the reflection questions they resonate well into the favorite list.
  - Justification: Users might resonate well with some questions, they can use `like` command to add these questions into
the favorite list for review in the future. 
  - Highlights: The displayed index of questions(range from 1 to 5) might differ from their real indexes in the arrayList.
To match to the correct questions chosen by users, a **HashMap** is used with **display index**being the **key** and **real 
question index** being the **value**. 
- **New Feature 4:** List the reflection questions in the favorite list.
  - What it does: Allows users to list and review all reflection questions in the favorite list.
  - Justification: Users should not only add questions into the favorite list, but also review them.
- **New Feature 5:** Get the previous set of reflection questions.
  - What it does: Allows users to review the previous set of questions generated.
  - Justification: As users reflect on the generated questions, the previous questions may come into their mind. The `prev`
command allows users to easily refer back to the previous questions.
- **New Feature 6:** Return from Self Reflection feature back main WellNUS++.
  - What is does: Allows users to return from Self Reflection feature back to main WellNUS++.
  - Justification: WellNUS++ has a variety of features and users can navigate to different features from the main WellNUS++.
As such, it is essential to have this `home` feature.
- **Enhancement 1**: Abstract `QuestionList` class
  - What it does: Self Reflection section relies heavily on the set of random integers generated by `get` command(refer to feature 2)
and this set will be shared across different classes. Based on the Single Responsibility Principle, a `QuestionList` class is 
used to store and manipulate the lists of questions such as the random sets and the favorite list.
  - Implementation: A common `QuestionList` object is constructed upon launching the program and passed into different command object
constructors as an argument. As such, information of lists of questions and their associated methods are centralised and shared among classes.
- **Enhancement 2**: Remove reflection questions from the favorite list.
  - What it does: Allows users to remove reflection questions from the favorite list.
  - Justification: As time passes, users might no longer resonate with some questions and wish to remove those questions from
the favorite list. This feature is important without which the size of the favorite list will increment infinitely, making it 
inconvenient for users to review all the questions.
- **Enhancement 3:** Store Self Reflection data in data file.
  - What is does: Allows Self Reflection data to be stored in a data file.
  - Justification: To ensure the sustainability of WellNUS++, user data should be stored for users to use in the long run.
- **Enhancement 4:** Add tests to TextUi and Self Reflection
  - Unit tests are added for all classes in the `reflection` package to make sure the code functions as expected before integration.
- **Enhancement 5:** Standardize error message across WellNUS++.
  - Implementation:A standardised format of error message is used across WellNUS++. The messages pinpoint the specific 
error made(e.g. wrong command keyword, extra payload) and the correct usage of the command is given to better guide users.

  WellNUS++ comes with a variety of features to help you enhance your overall wellness in NUS! The features are Atomic
  Habit, Self Reflection, Focus Timer and Gamification. Each feature has its own set of commands for users to explore.
  Users can navigate to different features from main WellNUS++ and return from each feature back to main
  WellNUS++ using `home` command. Do note that users can only `exit` the program from main WellNUS++.
  ![WellNUS++ Structure Overview](../diagrams/WellNusStructure.png)
- Self Reflection section:<br>
  <br>
  **Accessing self reflection feature: reflect**

  Format: `reflect`

  Self reflection feature allows users to get sets of random introspective questions to reflect on to improve overall
  wellness and achieve better selves.

  Example of usage: `reflect`
  Expected outcome:

  ```
  ============================================================
    #####                       ######                                           
   #     # ###### #      ###### #     # ###### ###### #      ######  ####  #####

    #####  ###### ###### #      #     # ###### #      ###### ######  ####    #   
  ============================================================
      Welcome to WellNUS++ Self Reflection section :D
      Feel very occupied and cannot find time to self reflect?
      No worries, this section will give you the opportunity to reflect and improve on yourself!!
  ============================================================
  ```
  **Add reflection question into favorite list: like INDEX**

  Users can add the reflection question they like into favorite list and review afterwards.

  Format: `like INDEX`

  Note that the users are supposed to at least `get` a set of questions or use `prev` command to
  review the previous set before liking them, and use the displayed index to choose questions.
  Index parameter is limited to integer 1-5 as only 5 questions will be generated in every random set.

  Example of usage:`like 1`
  Expected output:

  ```
  ============================================================
      You have added question: What is my purpose in life? into favorite list!!
  ============================================================
  ```

  **View favorite list: fav**

  Users can review the list of reflection questions they liked.

  Format: `fav`
  Example of usage:`fav`
  Example output:

  ```
  ============================================================
      1.What are three of my most cherished personal values?
      2.What is my purpose in life?
      3.Am I making time for my social life?
  ============================================================
  ```

  **Remove questions from favorite list: unlike INDEX**

  Users can remove reflection questions from the favorite list.

  Format: `unlike INDEX`

  Take note that it is **recommended** to use `fav` command to check the list of questions in the favorite list before
  unliking any of them, so that users are aware which question they are removing.

  Example of usage step 1: `fav`
  Example output step 1:
  ```
  ============================================================
      1.What are three of my most cherished personal values?
      2.What is my purpose in life?
      3.Am I making time for my social life?
  ============================================================
  ``` 
  Example of usage step 2: `unlike 1`
  Example output step 2:
  ```
  ============================================================
      You have removed question: What are three of my most cherished personal values? from favorite list!!
  ============================================================
  ``` 
  **Get the previous set of reflection questions generated: prev**

  Users can view the previous set of questions generated for review. Note that the users are supposed to at
  least `get` a set of questions before viewing the previous set.

  Format: `prev`
  Example of usage: `prev`
  Example output:

  ```
  ============================================================
      1.What is my purpose in life?
      2.What is my personality type?
      3.Did I make time for myself this week?
      4.Am I making time for my social life?
      5.What is something I find inspiring?
