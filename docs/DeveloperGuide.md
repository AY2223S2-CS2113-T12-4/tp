## Setting up, getting started

### Setting up the project in your computer

Firstly, **fork** this repo, and **clone** the fork into your computer. <br>
<br>
If you plan to use Intellij IDEA (highly recommended): <br>

1. **Configure the JDK**: Follow the guide
   [[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the JDK](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html)
   to ensure Intellij is configured to use **JDK 11**.
2. **Import the project as a Gradle project**: Follow the guide
   [[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Importing a Gradle project](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html)
   to import the project into IDEA.<br>
   **Note**: Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project.
3. **Verify the setup:**
    1. Run the ```wellnus.WellNus``` and try a few commands.
    2. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.

### Before writing code

1. **Configure the coding style**<br>
   If using IDEA, follow the guide
   [[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the code style](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html)
   to set up IDEAâ€™s coding style to match ours.<br>
   <br>
2. **Set up CI**<br>
   This project comes with a GitHub Actions config files (in `.github/workflows` folder).
   When GitHub detects those files, it will run the CI for your project automatically at each push
   to the `master` branch or to any PR. No set up required.<br>
   <br>
3. **Learn the design**<br>
   When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you look at the class diagrams to understand the structure of
   the
   code and the interaction among different classes.<br>

## Design & implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

### CommandParser Component

The CommandParser is a core feature of WellNUS++.
It defines the following:

1. The syntax for users to input commands
2. A common API for developers to **process** user input

#### Design Considerations

The CommandParser is implicitly used by users 100% of the time.
It is the abstraction through which the users will interact with WellNUS++'s features.
Its ease of use is critical to ensure a good user experience.

**User design Considerations**:  
Our [target user profile](#target-user-profile) are Computing and Engineering students.
With that, we have done extensive research and laid out the following design considerations.

1. **Easy learning curve**  
   Our users are often strapped for time and tend to prefer to use tools that
   they are familiar with or can learn quickly. Our command syntax should be easy
   to remember, predictable and intuitive.
2. **Flexible usage**  
   "Arguments" for a command should not care about the order of arguments.
   Users often type what comes to mind first. Allowing flexible order of arguments
   reduces the cognitive load on the user's end and allows for a
   more pleasant experience.

**Developer Design Considerations**:  
Virtually every feature in WellNUS++ will require user input to be processed. This means that all features
will have to interact with `CommandParser`. Hence, the
design for the `CommandParser` API must be understandable, unambiguous and easy to develop on.

3. **Easy way to extract components of user input**  
   Each component of userInput (arguments, payload, etc) should be obtainable in predictable and non-arbitrary way.
   Arbitrary way (using index) is not preferred as it is prone to developer erros.
4. **Easy way to validate user input**  
   There should also be built-in ways to easily validate components of user input for a command,
   such as checking length.

#### CommandParser Syntax

The command parser defines any arbitrary user input to be valid
if it follows the following structure.

```
mainCommand [payload] [--argument1 [payload1] --argument2 [payload2] ... ]
```

This should be familiar to you. It is similar to how most CLI applications process arguments in the wild.

![Example](diagrams/git_command.png)
<figcaption align="center">Example of CLI input syntax in the wild</figcaption>

This achieves design consideration (1). Why?  
This syntax is intuitive at a glance to our target users,
is predictable and easy to remember as the only thing they need to remember is the argument name and
the '--' delimiter.

From this syntax, we can generalise ALL user inputs as `(argument, payload)` pairs.  
`mainCommand` is a special `argument`, where it MUST be the first word in the user input.

Due to the unique one-to-one relationship between arguments and payloads, we can model a user input
using this syntax using a `HashMap` mapping each `argument` to a `payload`.

For example,
`
$ foo bar --arg1 payload1 payload1--1 --arg2 payload2 --arg3
`

Will be mapped as:
`
(foo, bar), (arg1 payload1 payload1--1), (arg2 payload2), (arg3, "")
`
where `""` represents an empty string (for visualization).

Using a `HashMap` fulfils design considerations (2), (3) and (4).

- (2): Order of arguments do not matter as
- (3): To get a `payload`, the developer simply needs to call `myHashMap.get("argument")`.  
  This syntatic sugar prevents developer errors compared to an index-based approach.
- (4): Validating commands is much less difficult using `HashMap`. For example, size can be checked with
  built-in `.size()`,
  argument existence can be queried with `.containsKey()`.

#### Integration with WellNUS++

![Integration](diagrams/CommandParserClass.png)

`CommandParser` integrates into the boilerplate via the abstract Manager class.  
All features are controlled by a manager subclass - hence the developers just need to call
`getCommandParser` to get a reference to the `CommandParser` taking care of all commands
in the `Manager` subclass.

#### CommandParser API

There are only two methods that developers need to know to use `CommandParser`.

1. `parseUserInput`
2. `getMainArgument`

**Usage: `parseUserInput`**

`parseUserInput` is used to get a `HashMap` representation of the user input, a bijection
between `argument` and `payload` pairs.

Implementation of `parseUserInput`:

![CommandParser implementation](diagrams/CommandParserSequence.png)

`parseUserInput(String userInput)` is used to directly convert a string into their argument-payload pairs.
It first calls `splitIntoCommand` to split input over the `' --'` delimiter to get a `String[] commands`.
Each `command` in `commands[]` contain the argument and payload. Internally, it splits the
argument from the payload and populates a `HashMap` with the one-to-one mapping. After all `command`s have
been processed, the map is returned to the `Manager` for usage.

**Sample Code**

```java
// Example usage to get the HashMap
public class FooManager extends Manager {
    public HashMap<String, String> handleCommand(String userInput) {
        // Get a reference to the parser
        CommandParser parser = getCommandParser();
        // Get the one-to-one mapping
        HashMap<String, String> result = parseUserInput(userInput);
        return result;
    }
}
```

**Usage: `getMainCommand(userInput)`**

To understand what the user wants to do, we need a convenient way to get the `mainCommand` from the user input.
The canonical way to do this is to use `getMainCommand`. This defeats adversarial input where the main command
is input as an argument.

Internally, this just splits the string by whitespace and returns the first word in the array.

#### Alternative Designs Considered

We considered alternative command structures such as [AB3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/UserGuide.html)
where input types are
specified , `e.g. n/John Doe` which more 'secure' from the get go.
However, due to the following issues, AB3 was not chosen as the alternative solution compared to the shell-like
structure.

**Steep learning curve**  
For experienced and inexperienced users, it is a hassle to remember what letter corresponds to what argument.
For AB3, the user needs to remember all the different `char` 'verbs' such as `e/` for email, `n/` for name.
This violates design consideration (1).

**Does not scale well**  
AB3 structure runs the high risk of argument-space collision as well.  
For example, consider a command that needs an "email" and "entry". What does `e/<payload>` correspond to?
We could simply just put entry as *some other character* -- but that defeats the purpose of having the structure in the
first place as the character is the argument's first character.
This makes behaviour **unpredictable** and a **confusing** user experience.

**Bad expert user experience**

For expert users and CLI-masters, pedantic argument input like AB3 makes the typing experience MUCH slower due to the
need to type which is relatively clunky as the user will need to type far off to the '/' key on the keyboard.

### AtomicHabit Component

![AtomicHabit Component](diagrams/AtomicHabit.png)
The `AtomicHabit` component is responsible for tracking the user's daily habits.
It consists of the `feature` package and the `command` package.

The `command` package consists of the `AddCommand`, `HomeCommand`, `ListCommand`, `UpdateCommand`.

* `AddCommand` - Adds a new habit to the user's habit list.
* `HomeCommand` - Returns the user back to main interface.
* `ListCommand` - Lists all the user's habits.
* `UpdateCommand` - Updates the user's habit count.

The `feature` package contains the `AtomicHabit` class, the `AtomicHabitList` class and the `AtomicHabitManager` class.
The `AtomicHabit` class represents a single habit, while the `AtomicHabitList` class represents the list of all the
user's habit and the `AtomicHabitManager` class is the class that manages the `AtomicHabitList` class and executes
the `commands`.

The `AtomicHabitManager` class utilises `TextUi` class to process user inputs and execute the `commands` accordingly.

The `AtomicHabitList` class is implemented as an ArrayList of `AtomicHabit` objects.

The `AtomicHabit` class has the following attributes:

* `description` - the description of the habit
* `count` - the number of times the habit is done

### Object Diagram

## Product scope

### Target user profile

* NUS Computing and Engineering students
* Spend lots of time coding on their IDE and type relatively fast
* Have to regularly use digital gadgets and Internet for their courses
* Very familiar with command line interfaces
* Stressed about academy and many others
* Busy with work and drowning in deadlines
* Wants to improve their wellness
* Sometimes unmotivated with short attention span

### Value proposition

NUS Computing and Engineering students are often busy with work and sometimes will neglect their wellness. This app aims
to help NUS Computing and Engineering students improve their overall wellness by encouraging the **cultivation of
meaningful
atomic habits**, **practice of self reflection** and **usage of offline timer to stay focused**. By using this app,
we hope users will be more aware of the healthiness of their daily life and take actions to improve their wellness.<br>
<br>
WellNUS++ is a CLI app, primarily due to the following reasons:

* Computing students generally type fast and prefer typing to mouse due to their daily coding routines.
* Due to the data heavy nature and personalised user input of this app, typing will be preferred to clicking.
* In particular, our application is built to reduce context switching. Users can launch the application from the comfort
  of their favourite IDEâ€™s terminal to reduce disruption to their daily coding lives.
* Instead of using electronics with fancy GUI, this CLI app gives computing students an opportunity to minimise digital
  interaction which will be beneficial for their wellness.
* The app is gamified to make it more attractive for students to use. Levels and micro-goals incentivise our
  users to keep using the appâ€™s features, allowing them to focus on their work and achieve wellness.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any mainstream OS as long as it has Java 11 or above installed.
2. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should
   be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

## Glossary

* *glossary item* - Definition
* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Main Command**: The first WORD that a user types in. `e.g. reflect, exit`
* **Argument**: A word that is a parameter to a `Main Command` and is prefixed by ` --`. `e.g. --id, --name`
* **Payload**: An (optional) arbitrary sequence of characters immediately following a main command or argument.
  The payload will terminate when the user clicks `enter` or separates the payload with another argument
  with the `--` delimiter.
